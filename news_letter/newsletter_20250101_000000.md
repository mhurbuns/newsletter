# Planting basics: getting started

This is an example issue. Edit this file, or add new issues in `news_letter/`.

## Quick wins for beginners

- Start small: one sunny windowsill pot is enough.
- Water less than you think—most plants die from overwatering.
- Choose “easy-mode” plants: basil, mint, pothos, snake plant.

## What’s next

- Pick one plant and one container.
- Add a simple weekly routine (light + water + quick check).
- Publish your next issue by adding another Markdown file.
