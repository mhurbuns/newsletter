# Planting basics: soil, light, and watering

Your plants mostly want three things: the right light, the right soil, and the right watering rhythm.

## Light (the #1 factor)

- **Bright indirect light**: near a window, but not harsh sun all day.
- **Full sun**: 6+ hours of direct sun (great for many herbs and veggies).
- **Low light**: fewer options—choose hardy houseplants like snake plant.

## Soil (keep it simple)

- Use a **potting mix** for containers (not outdoor garden dirt).
- Add **perlite** if your mix stays wet too long.
- Make sure your pot has a **drainage hole**.

## Watering (avoid the classic mistake)

- Water when the **top inch of soil is dry** (finger test).
- Water thoroughly, then let excess drain out.
- If leaves yellow and soil is wet, you’re probably overwatering.

## Tiny challenge

Pick one plant and write down:
1) where it will live (light)
2) what pot + soil you’ll use
3) how you’ll remember to check it weekly
